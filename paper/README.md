## Abstract

The proliferation of wireless networks has increased the need for robust and scalable intrusion detection systems. Traditional centralized approaches face challenges in terms of privacy, scalability, and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose FedVAE-KD, a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for wireless network intrusion detection. Our approach combines Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for efficient feature extraction and knowledge distillation (KD) for model compression, enabling scalable deployment while preserving data privacy. We introduce cryptographic techniques and differential privacy mechanisms to enhance security. Experimental results on multiple network intrusion detection datasets demonstrate that FedVAE-KD achieves superior performance compared to baseline methods while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. The framework reduces communication overhead by 60% compared to traditional federated learning approaches and achieves an accuracy improvement of 8-12% over existing privacy-preserving methods.
